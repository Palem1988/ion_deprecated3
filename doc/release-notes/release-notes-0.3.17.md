Versbitcoin 0.3.17 is now available.

Changes:
* new getwork, thanks m0mchil
* added transactbitcoin fee setting in UI optbitcoins menu
* free transactbitcoin limits
* sendtoaddress returns transactbitcoin id instead of "sent"
* getaccountaddress <account>

The UI transactbitcoin fee setting was easy since it was still there from 0.1.5 and all I had to do was re-enable it.

The accounts-based commands: move, sendfrom and getbalance <account> will be in the next release.  We still have some more changes to make first.
